If you can keep your head when all about you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are losing theirs and blaming it on you,
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But make allowance for their doubting too;
If you can wait and not be tired by waiting,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or being lied about, don’t deal in lies,
Or being hated, don’t give way to hating,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yet don’t look too good, nor talk too wise:

If you can dream—and not make dreams your master;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can think—and not make thoughts your aim;
If you can meet with Triumph and Disaster
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And treat those two impostors just the same;
If you can bear to hear the truth you’ve spoken
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Twisted by knaves to make a trap for fools,
Or watch the things you gave your life to, broken,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And stoop and build ’em up with worn-out tools:

If you can make one heap of all your winnings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And risk it on one turn of pitch-and-toss,
And lose, and start again at your beginnings
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And never breathe a word about your loss;
If you can force your heart and nerve and sinew
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To serve your turn long after they are gone,
And so hold on when there is nothing in you
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except the Will which says to them: ‘Hold on!’

If you can talk with crowds and keep your virtue,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or walk with Kings—nor lose the common touch,
If neither foes nor loving friends can hurt you,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If all men count with you, but none too much;
If you can fill the unforgiving minute
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With sixty seconds’ worth of distance run,
Yours is the Earth and everything that’s in it,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And—which is more—you’ll be a Man, my son!
