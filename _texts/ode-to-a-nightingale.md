My heart aches, and a drowsy numbness pains
&nbsp;&nbsp;My sense, as though of hemlock I had drunk,
Or emptied some dull opiate to the drains
&nbsp;&nbsp;One minute past, and Lethe-wards had sunk:
‘Tis not through envy of thy happy lot,
&nbsp;&nbsp;But being too happy in thine happiness, —
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That thou, light-winged Dryad of the trees,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some melodious plot
&nbsp;&nbsp;Of beechen green, and shadows numberless,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Singest of summer in full-throated ease.

O, for a draught of vintage! that hath been
&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool’d a long age in the deep-delved earth,
Tasting of Flora and the country green,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Dance, and Provencal song, and sunburnt mirth!
O for a beaker full of the warm South,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Full of the true, the blushful Hippocrene,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With beaded bubbles winking at the brim,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And purple-stained mouth;
&nbsp;&nbsp;That I might drink, and leave the world unseen,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with thee fade away into the forest dim:

Fade far away, dissolve, and quite forget
&nbsp;&nbsp;What thou among the leaves hast never known,
The weariness, the fever, and the fret
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, where men sit and hear each other groan;
Where palsy shakes a few, sad, last gray hairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where youth grows pale, and spectre-thin, and dies;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where but to think is to be full of sorrow
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And leaden-eyed despairs,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Where Beauty cannot keep her lustrous eyes,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or new Love pine at them beyond to-morrow.

Away! away! for I will fly to thee,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Not charioted by Bacchus and his lepards,
But on the viewless wings of Poesy,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Though the dull brain perplexes and retards:
Already with thee! tender is the night,
&nbsp;&nbsp;And haply the Queen-Moon is on her throne,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cluster’d around by all her starry Fays;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But here there is no light,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Save what from heaven is with the breezes blown
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through verdurous glooms and winding mossy ways.

I cannot see what flowers are at my feet,
&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor what soft incense hangs upon the boughs,
But, in embalmed darkness, guess each sweet
&nbsp;&nbsp;Wherewith the seasonable month endows
The grass, the thicket, and the fruit-tree wild;
&nbsp;&nbsp;White hawthorn, and the pastoral eglantine;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fast fading violets cover'd up in leaves;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And mid-May's eldest child,
&nbsp;&nbsp;The coming musk-rose, full of dewy wine,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The murmurous haunt of flies on summer eves.

Darkling I listen; and, for many a time
&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been half in love with easeful Death,
Call’d him soft names in many a mused rhyme,
&nbsp;&nbsp;To take into the air my quiet breath;
Now more than ever seems it rich to die,
&nbsp;&nbsp;To cease upon the midnight with no pain,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While thou art pouring forth thy soul abroad
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In such an ecstasy!
&nbsp;&nbsp;Still wouldst thou sing, and I have ears in vain —
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To thy high requiem become a sod.

Thou wast not born for death, immortal Bird!
&nbsp;&nbsp;No hungry generations tread thee down;
The voice I hear this passing night was heard
&nbsp;&nbsp;In ancient days by emperor and clown:
Perhaps the self-same song that found a path
&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the sad heart of Ruth, when, sick for home,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She stood in tears amid the alien corn;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same that oft-times hath
&nbsp;&nbsp;Charm’d magic casements, opening on the foam
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of perilous seas, in faery lands forlorn.

Forlorn! the very word is like a bell
&nbsp;&nbsp;To toil me back from thee to my sole self!
Adieu! the fancy cannot cheat so well
&nbsp;&nbsp;As she is fam'd to do, deceiving elf.
Adieu! adieu! thy plaintive anthem fades
&nbsp;&nbsp;Past the near meadows, over the still stream,
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Up the hill-side; and now 'tis buried deep
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the next valley-glades:
&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it a vision, or a waking dream?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fled is that music:— Do I wake or sleep?
