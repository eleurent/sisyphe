Read me a lesson, Muse, and speak it loud
&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon the top of Nevis, blind in mist!
I look into the chasms, and a shroud
&nbsp;&nbsp;Vaporous doth hide them; just so much I wist
Mankind do know of hell: I look o’erhead,
&nbsp;&nbsp;And there is sullen mist; even so much
Mankind can tell of heaven: mist is spread
&nbsp;&nbsp;Before the earth, beneath me; even such,
Even so vague is man’s sight of himself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;Here are the craggy stones beneath my feet;
Thus much I know that, a poor witless elf,
&nbsp;&nbsp;I tread on them; that all my eye doth meet
Is mist and crag — not only on this height,
But in the world of thought and mental might.
